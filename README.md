# Automotive Safety System

An embedded computer vision system designed to improve driver safety by detecting and responding to emotional and behavioural cues in real time.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project uses a camera connected to a Raspberry Pi to monitor the driver’s facial expressions and detect signs of:
- Drowsiness
- Distraction
- Frustration or Anger

When such states are detected, the system issues auditory or visual prompts to alert or assist the driver, encouraging safe driving behaviour.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect driver emotions using facial landmark analysis and pre-trained machine learning models.
- Run entirely on edge hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi) without relying on cloud processing.
- Provide real-time feedback via visual or auditory alerts.
- Log data for system performance and improvement analysis.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, USB/Pi Camera
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch
- **Tools**: Google Docs (logbook), Git for version control
